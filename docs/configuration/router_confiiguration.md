# Router Configuration

If you want to make certain Ansible-NAS applications available outside of your home (for example Nextcloud), then you need to map ports 80 and 443 from your router to your Ansible-NAS box.

How to do this is entirely dependent on your router (and out of scope of these docs), but if you're using Ansible-NAS then this should be within your skillset. :)
